Model-driven process engine for building mission-oriented control systems.
The model is loosely based on BPMN2: start/stop/signal events; exclusive gateway; service task; script task.
The script engine is ChaiScript.  Also tried duktape and v8.

One day this code will be driving a small surface drone, hopefully off the Georgia (USA) coast.
